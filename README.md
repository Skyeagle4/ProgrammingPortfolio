## Checkers
This project was a group project put together by a team of year 1 programmers. We had the intitial goal to have a light up checkers board, which is the completed project, but with an end goal of being able to play just by pressing on the tiles, which have a button set underneath an opaque tile on top, which allows 2 players to play against one another simply by tapping the piece they want to move, and moving it to the square they would like to move to. This is done through the use of an Arduino UNO, 4 breadboards, and over 500 lines of code.

### Commission Calculator
This project was an individual project. It uses c++ inheritance to allow user input to determine the commission that would be received for selling various real estate properties.

**Code** [project code](https://github.com/Skyeagle4/ProgrammingPortfolio/blob/master/ProgrammingFolder/Language%20Migration/inheritance.cpp)



#### Screen Saver
This project was an individual project. It uses java to allow a screen saver to be used and created on any computer system.

**Code** [project code](https://github.com/Skyeagle4/ProgrammingPortfolio/tree/master/ProgrammingFolder/Programming%20S1/screenSaver)



##### 99 Bottles
This project was an individual project. It uses c++ to allow a computer console "sing" a the 99 bottles song.

**Code** [project code](https://github.com/Skyeagle4/ProgrammingPortfolio/blob/master/ProgrammingFolder/Language%20Migration/99bottles.cpp) 



###### Calculator
This project was an individual project. It uses java to allow a user to interact with the calculator on screen of a computer, and will perform basic computer calculations, with some more advanced options mixed in with it.

###### Piglatin Transcriber
This project was an individual project. It uses c++ to allow a user to interact with the program and input a phrase that will then be translated into Piglatin.

**Code** [project code](https://github.com/Skyeagle4/ProgrammingPortfolio/blob/master/ProgrammingFolder/Language%20Migration/pigLatin.cpp)
