## Checkers
This project was a group project put together by a team of year 1 programmers. We had the intitial goal to have a light up checkers board, which is the completed project, but with an end goal of being able to play just by pressing on the tiles, which have a button set underneath an opaque tile on top, which allows 2 players to play against one another simply by tapping the piece they want to move, and moving it to the square they would like to move to. This is done through the use of an Arduino UNO, 4 breadboards, and over 500 lines of code.
