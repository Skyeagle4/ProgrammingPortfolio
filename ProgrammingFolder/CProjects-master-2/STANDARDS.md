# [822 Computer Programming 1B (C++)](http://www.schools.utah.gov/cte/documents/it/standards/ComputerProgrammingI.pdf)

This is an intermediate class in computer programming/software engineering and applications. It reviews and builds on the concepts introduced in Computer Programming IA, meaning that you will be tested on language specific concepts from semester one (i.e. data types, decision making, iteration, functions, classes etc.) This semester introduces students to more complex data structures and their uses, including sequential files, arrays, and classes. Students will learn to create more powerful programs. The skills test covers skills learned in Computer Programming 1A & 1B.
